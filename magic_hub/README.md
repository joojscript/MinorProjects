Magic Hub
=============


> I always love so much magic, and how it can make us feel like everything is possible. Some weeks ago I was learning more about flutter, and decided I should make a nice project on Flutter web, since I just developed until then with Flutter Mobile. By needing an idea about what to do, the first thing that came to my mind is what you see right here!

> A responsive Magical Social Media, with the User and Post CRUD's (in development), and a free space to share magic stuff with your friends ( and me! :D )
